# Hermes Slide Director Status

## Current state

- Project created as a clean-start repository at `/home/hskim/projects/hermes-slide-director`.
- GitHub private repo created and pushed at `https://github.com/Han43seong/hermes-slide-director`; local `origin` tracks `origin/main`.
- Purpose: Hermes-orchestrated Claude Design loop harness for high-fidelity slide decks.
- The project intentionally starts from product/architecture contracts before implementing a dashboard or generator.
- Existing `slide-harness` remains as prior experiment/reference; this project is the new direction.

## Active product model

User supplies:

1. Research material: reports, RFPs, notes, PDFs/text extracts, URLs, or proposal drafts.
2. Design reference: template link, Claude Design reference, website/brand reference, screenshot, or style brief.
3. Optional constraints: audience, purpose, slide count, tone, language, must-include/must-exclude items.

Hermes then:

1. Analyzes material and design reference.
2. Proposes verification criteria.
3. Waits for user review/edit/approval.
4. Directs Claude Design-style HTML deck generation.
5. Renders PDF/screenshots.
6. Runs content/design/readability/export QA.
7. Creates revision briefs and loops until pass or max iteration.

## Recent progress

- `2026-05-14`: Dogfooded the new JARVIS Producer/Reviewer rejection loop on Phase 0 domain models.
  - Producer: delegate_task implementation agent.
  - Reviewer: separate delegate_task critic.
  - Reviewer verdict: `PASS`.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q` -> `6 passed`; `PYTHONPATH=src python -m hermes_slide_director.cli doctor` -> OK; `python -m py_compile src/hermes_slide_director/*.py` -> OK.
  - Commit: `f8433f1 feat: add Phase 0 domain models`.
- `2026-05-14`: Built Phase 1 CLI-only source ingestion and deterministic criteria proposal.
  - GitHub initial project push completed.
  - Commands added: `propose-criteria` and `approve-criteria`.
  - Artifacts: `job.json`, `inputs/metadata.json`, copied material/design-reference inputs, `criteria/proposed.json`, `criteria/proposed.md`, `criteria/approved.json`, `criteria/approved.md`.
  - Baseline criteria cover content, narrative, design, readability, export, and risk.
  - Producer/Reviewer loop: initial reviewer requested path-only `--materials` enforcement and README correction; fixes applied; final reviewer verdict `PASS`.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q` -> `10 passed`; doctor OK; propose/approve smoke OK; missing-material smoke exits non-zero with expected message.
  - Commit: `34bb0d0 feat: add Phase 1 criteria proposal CLI`.
- `2026-05-14`: Built Phase 2 dry-run generation prompt contract.
  - Command added: `prepare-generation --run <run_dir> [--deck-title ...] [--audience ...] [--language ...] [--slide-count ...]`.
  - Artifacts: `generation/producer-contract.json` and `generation/producer-brief.md`.
  - The contract records job id, run marker, title/audience/language/slide count, source materials, design references, approved criteria path, required producer outputs, constraints, and QA inputs.
  - `job.json` status moves to `generating` to mark generation preparation; no deck/renderer/LLM call is performed yet.
  - Producer/Reviewer loop: separate reviewer verdict `PASS`.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest -q` -> `14 passed`; doctor OK; propose -> approve -> prepare-generation smoke OK.
  - Commit: `3f257a0 feat: add Phase 2 generation brief CLI`.

## Next steps

1. Add actual producer execution adapter in dry-run-first form: consume `generation/producer-brief.md`, write a placeholder `iterations/001/` output contract, and keep external LLM/OMC calls optional/explicit.
2. Add renderer checks for HTML/PDF/screenshots once a deck artifact exists.
3. Add critic report schema persistence and one QA loop.
4. Add dashboard only after CLI proof and quality loop are stable.
